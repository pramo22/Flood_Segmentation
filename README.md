# Flood_Segmentation and Disaster Analysis

This project is designed to perform flood segmentation using deep learning techniques. It includes a UNet-based segmentation model trained to identify flooded areas from satellite imagery. The system also supports instance segmentation, change detection, and visualization of results through a Flask web application.
